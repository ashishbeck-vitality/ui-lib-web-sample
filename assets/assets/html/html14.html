<h2>Exercise to boost your mental fitness</h2>

<p>Give your brain a boost with exercise. We all know that exercise makes us physically strong and fit. You can feel your muscles, heart and lungs when you work-out, and feel your strength and endurance building. But did you know that exercise also gets your brain in shape?<br />
<br />
Regular physical activity promotes improved memory, learning ability, emotional regulation and overall mental well-being. It can improve your mood, reduce feelings of anxiety and depression, increase self-esteem and is a proven form of stress relief. One explanation for all these benefits is that exercise provides the brain with a better supply of blood which improves delivery of oxygen and nutrients, and increases volume of some regions of the brain. This in turn assists with brain cell communication. Emerging science suggests that exercise may even promote growth of new brain cells in the hippocampus an area of the brain involved in memory, emotional regulation and learning.<br />
<br />
Moreover, increasingly robust evidence suggests that exercise is not only good? or the promotion and maintenance of mental well-being, but it can be used to treat chronic mental illness. Exercise appears to be as good as prescription medicine across a range of conditions, such as mild to moderate depression, dementia, and anxiety!<br />
<br />
Using a wearable fitness device or setting your mobile device to measure your physical activity can be a good way to remind and inspire you to be active and reap these mental health benefits. Any amount of physical activity or exercise is good but the more the better. The recommendation for health and wellness benefits is at least 150 minutes of moderate or vigorous physical activity or a combination thereof, weekly.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span><br />
